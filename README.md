## 📝️ How it Works?

It is placed on the `Localhost` or `Personal Host`, after that you enter the panel with the default username and password of the tool. If you want to test which template to give to the victim, you can access the templates section from the top left section [1].
Then, if you want to give the desired phishing template link to the victim, you can choose the template section and get the link of your desired template.
Then give it to the victim and enjoy this tool.

> ⚠️ Attention [1]: If you enter the templates section and it asks for your username and password, give it the default username and password of the panel and go to the templates section again. Don't worry, this tool is designed to monitor all the victim's thoughts and make sure that the victim does not have access to the hacker panel.


**`how to run personal host 👇`**

> Zip the contents of the storm-web folder completely and upload it to the public_html path .
